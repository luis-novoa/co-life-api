# Co-Life

In this project, I built the API of Co-Life, an app focused on advertising co-living opportunities. You can use this API to can create and manage your account, your ads and your favorite list. I also added administrator privileges to one account. Check the [documentation](https://raw.githack.com/luis-novoa/co-life-doc/gh-pages/index.html) to understand how to interact with it.

## Built With

- Ruby v2.6.5
- Ruby on Rails v6.0.3.1
- Visual Studio Code

## Live Demo

Send HTTP requests to [https://co-life.herokuapp.com/](https://runnerln.herokuapp.com/) to interact with the API!

Now you have a copy of this repository in your profile and in your computer!

### Prerequisites

- Ruby: 2.6.5
- Rails: 6.0.3.1
- Postgres: >=9.5

### Setup

Navigate to the project folder using your terminal.
Install gems with:

```
$ bundle install
```
This project uses PostGreSQL, so you'll need to assign a PostGres User to it. Run this to create a new user:

```
$ sudo -u postgres createuser -s yourUserName -P
```

Either if you're using a brand new user or an existing one, remember its username and password. Access `\config\database.yml` with your favorite text editor and go to line 24:

```
18  default: &default
19    adapter: postgresql
20    encoding: unicode
21    # For details on connection pooling, see Rails configuration guide
22    # https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#database-pooling
23    pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
24    username: TYPE HERE THE USERNAME OF YOUR POSTGRES USER
25    password: <%= ENV['RUNNER_CAPSTONE_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
```

Next, on your terminal, run the following:

```
$ echo 'export APPNAME_DATABASE_PASSWORD="PostgreSQL_Role_Password"' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

Now that your PostGreSQL user is set, setup database with:

```
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:migrate
```

### Usage

Start server with:

```
$ rails server
```

Open the command line or a program for sending HTTP requests and make requests to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.

### Run tests
This project was done entirely using the TDD methodology. So far, 152 tests were created and all of them are satisfied. Run the following code to execute them:

```
$ rpsec --format documentation
```
